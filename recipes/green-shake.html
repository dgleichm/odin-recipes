    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This is a favorite of mine to whip up after having the kids toil in the fields of my 50 acre homestead. 
        The children despise the flavor, which is how I know I got the blend just right. It is so cute to
    see them blech and retch as they force down the drink knowing if they don't finish, there will be no other 
    food that day. The cherry on top is the meek little thank you they give that I know is insincere, but 
    I rather have politeness and respect than honesty.
</p>

    <p>I learned to like this recipe growing up. My mom and her mom and generations before used this 
        recipe. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night sweating, rubbing my head, and remembering
        how my mother would smack me with a wooden spoon if I didn't finish the drink. Then I am awashed with an 
        uncontrollable urge to cry, so I pinch myself hard, sometimes hard enough to bleed, to distract
        myself from the turmoil and agony roiling inside. I am thankful she taught me the meaning of respect. 
    </p>
