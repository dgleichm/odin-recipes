    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Meringue is an unwieldy <strong>beast</strong>. 
        Only the most <em>patient</em> and <em>skilled</em> baker
         should ever attempt to concoct this creation. If at <strong><em>any</em></strong> 
         point a step is not executed with the utmost precision, lives will be lost. </p>

    <p><strong>RIP Aunt Charla</strong></p>

    <p>Anyway, meringue is a delightfully silky and luscious frosting. Meringue begins with egg whites 
        and sugar and is transformed into billowy white clouds of pure deliciousness.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Eggs</strong> - Fresh eggs are best for making meringue. 
            Using boxed or carton egg whites is not recommended, as they are usually 
            pasteurized, and that processing can sometimes keep the meringue from 
            getting completely glossy and stiff.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Cream of tartar</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Beat the egg whites</strong> using a mixer on medium speed 
            (or by hand) until they are broken up and frothy.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Add</strong> the cream of tartar, salt, and vanilla extract.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Beat to soft peaks</strong> on medium-high speed.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Gradually add the sugar</strong>, a couple of tablespoons at a time, 
            until it has all been incorporated.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Continue beating until glossy, stiff peaks form.</strong> At this point, 
            you can’t overbeat the meringue, so keep beating until you’ve got those glossy, 
            firm peaks!</p></li>
    </ol>
